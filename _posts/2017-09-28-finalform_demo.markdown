Achieving good form in sport means you can lift weights you couldn't lift before, make shots you couldn't make before, and sink puts you couldn't sink before.

We approximate the body as a (semi) rigid body. This means by keeping track of the angles between various body parts at different points in time we can determine what constitutes perfect form. We also use neural nets trained to distinguish expert lifters from novices to find

You go in and perform the sport of choice:

LIFT 1
BAD CLEAN w/ annotations

Lift 1 FEED BACK:

Lift 2 feedack
BAD CLEAN w/ annotations

PUT a lift type classifier plot here!!
Explain how you use vgg!!!

Explain how you compute angle between line segments representing body parts!!!!

![My helpful screenshot]({{ finalform.com }}/downloads/clean_segmentation_example.png){:height="800px" width="2000px"} you see


We will discuss machine learning, physics: \\( sin(x^2) \\) , and provide some  `code` contributions.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
